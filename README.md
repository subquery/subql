**SubQuery enables better dApps by making decentralised data more accessible**

SubQuery allows every Substrate/Polkadot team to process and query their data. The project is inspired by the growth of data protocols serving the application layer and its aim is to help Polkadot/Substrate projects build better dApps by allowing anyone to reliably find and consume data faster. Today, anyone can query and extract Polkadot network data in only minutes and at no cost.

SubQuery aims to support all Substrate-compatible networks.

## Get Started
#### Installation
```shell
# Yarn
yarn global add @subql/cli @subql/node @subql/query

# NPM
npm install -g @subql/cli @subql/node @subql/query
```

#### Create a SubQuery project
You can follow our [Quick Start Guide](https://doc.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart.html) to learn how to create, initialize, build, and publish a new SubQuery Project using the `@subql/cli` tool.

You'll need [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Publish your SubQuery Project to our Managed Service
Don't want to worry about running your own SubQuery nodes? SubQuery provides a [managed hosted service](https://explorer.subquery.network) to the community for free. Follow our publishing guide to see how you can upload your project to [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network).

#### Run your own Indexer and Query Service
[Follow our guide](https://doc.subquery.network/run/run.html) to run your own SubQuery local node that you can use to debug, test, and run you own GraphQL server

You're going to need to a Postgres database, a node to extract chain data, and a moderately powerful computer to run the indexer in the background.

You'll also use our custom-built GraphQL query service [`@subql/query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subql/query) to interact with your SubQuery project.
