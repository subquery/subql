# SubQuery Code of Conduct

SubQuery, as contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Supporting for new contributors by providing help and pointing them to the right examples and documentation 
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any 
contributor for other behaviors that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all of SubQuery's content on GitHub, as well as at all official SubQuery 
events, whether offline or online.

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Issues

SubQuery encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. 
This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. 
In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by 
contacting support@subquery.network. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. SubQuery will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that 
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, 
the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality
of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.
