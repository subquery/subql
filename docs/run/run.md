# Running SubQuery Locally

This guide works through how to run a local SubQuery node on your infrastructure, which includes both the indexer and query service.
Don't want to worry about running your own SubQuery infrastructure? SubQuery provides a [managed hosted service](https://explorer.subquery.network) to the community for free. [Follow our publishing guide](../publish/publish.md) to see how you can upload your project to [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network).

## Using Docker

An alternative solution is to run a <strong>Docker Container</strong>, defined by the `docker-compose.yml` file. For a new project that has been just initialised you won't need to change anything here.

Under the project directory run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

It may take some time to download the required packages ([`@subql/node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subql/node), [`@subql/query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subql/query), and Postgres) for the first time but soon you'll see a running SubQuery node.

## Running an Indexer (subql/node)

Requirements:

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database (version 12 or higher). While the [SubQuery node](#start-a-local-subquery-node) is indexing the blockchain, the extracted data is stored in an external database instance.

A SubQuery node is an implementation that extracts substrate-based blockchain data per the SubQuery project and saves it into a Postgres database.

### Installation

```shell
# NPM
npm install -g @subql/node
```

Please note that we **DO NOT** encourage the use of `yarn global` due to its poor dependency management which may lead to an errors down the line.

Once installed, you can start a node with the following command:

```shell
subql-node <command>
```

### Key Commands

The following commands will assist you to complete the configuration of a SubQuery node and begin indexing.
To find out more, you can always run `--help`.

#### Point to local project path

```
subql-node -f your-project-path
```

#### Use a Dictionary

Using a full chain dictionary can dramatically speed up the processing of a SubQuery project during testing or during your first index. In some cases, we've seen indexing performance increases of up to 10x.

A full chain dictionary pre-indexes the location of all events and extrinsics within the specific chain and allows your node service to skip to relevant locations when indexing rather than inspecting each block.

You can add the dictionary endpoint in your `project.yaml` file (see [Manifest File](../create/manifest.md)), or specify it at run time using the following command:

```
subql-node --network-dictionary=https://api.subquery.network/sq/subquery/dictionary-polkadot
```

[Read more about how a SubQuery Dictionary works](../tutorials_examples/dictionary.md).

#### Connect to database

```
export DB_USER=postgres
export DB_PASS=postgres
export DB_DATABASE=postgres
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
subql-node -f your-project-path 
````

Depending on the configuration of your Postgres database (e.g. a different database password), please ensure also that both the indexer (`subql/node`) and the query service (`subql/query`) can establish a connection to it.

#### Specify a configuration file

```
subql-node -c your-project-config.yml
```

This will point the query node to a configuration file which can be in YAML or JSON format. Check out the example below.

```yaml
subquery: ../../../../subql-example/extrinsics
subqueryName: extrinsics
batchSize:100
localMode:true
```

#### Change the block fetching batch size

```
subql-node -f your-project-path --batch-size 200

Result:
[IndexerManager] fetch block [203, 402]
[IndexerManager] fetch block [403, 602]
```

When the indexer first indexes the chain, fetching single blocks will significantly decrease the performance. Increasing the batch size to adjust the number of blocks fetched will decrease the overall processing time. The current default batch size is 100.

#### Run in local mode

```
subql-node -f your-project-path --local
```

For debugging purposes, users can run the node in local mode. Switching to local model will create Postgres tables in the default schema `public`.

If local mode is not used, a new Postgres schema with the initial `subquery_ ` and corresponding project tables will be created.


#### Check your node health

There are 2 endpoints that you can use to check and monitor the health of a running SubQuery node.

- Health check endpoint that returns a simple 200 response
- Metadata endpoint that includes additional analytics of your running SubQuery node

Append this to the base URL of your SubQuery node. Eg `http://localhost:3000/meta` will return:

```bash
{
    "currentProcessingHeight": 1000699,
    "currentProcessingTimestamp": 1631517883547,
    "targetHeight": 6807295,
    "bestHeight": 6807298,
    "indexerNodeVersion": "0.19.1",
    "lastProcessedHeight": 1000699,
    "lastProcessedTimestamp": 1631517883555,
    "uptime": 41.151789063,
    "polkadotSdkVersion": "5.4.1",
    "apiConnected": true,
    "injectedApiConnected": true,
    "usingDictionary": false,
    "chain": "Polkadot",
    "specName": "polkadot",
    "genesisHash": "0x91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182fb8e20313b2c1eb49219da7a70ce90c3",
    "blockTime": 6000
}
```

`http://localhost:3000/health` will return HTTP 200 if successful. 

A 500 error will be returned if the indexer is not healthy. This can often be seen when the node is booting up.

```shell
{
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Indexer is not healthy"
}
```

If an incorrect URL is used, a 404 not found error will be returned.

```shell
{
"statusCode": 404,
"message": "Cannot GET /healthy",
"error": "Not Found"
}
```

#### Debug your project

Use the [node inspector](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) to run the following command.

```shell
node --inspect-brk <path to subql-node> -f <path to subQuery project>
```

For example:
```shell
node --inspect-brk /usr/local/bin/subql-node -f ~/Code/subQuery/projects/subql-helloworld/
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/56156753-c07d-4bbe-af2d-2c7ff4bcc5ad
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
Debugger attached.
```
Then open up the Chrome dev tools, go to Source > Filesystem and add your project to the workspace and start debugging. For more information, check out

## Running a Query Service (subql/query)

### Installation

```shell
# NPM
npm install -g @subql/query
```

Please note that we **DO NOT** encourage the use of `yarn global` due to its poor dependency management which may lead to an errors down the line.

### Running the Query service

```
export DB_HOST=localhost
subql-query --name <project_name> --playground
````

Make sure the project name is the same as the project name when you [initialize the project](../quickstart/quickstart.md#initialise-the-starter-subquery-project). Also, check the environment variables are correct.

After running the subql-query service successfully, open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a GraphQL playground showing in the Explorer and the schema that is ready to query.
