## SubQuery Example Projects

| Example | Description | Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [extrinsic-finalized-block](https://github.com/subquery/tutorials-extrinsic-finalised-blocks) | Indexes extrinsics so they can be queried by their hash | The simplest example with a __block handler__ function |
| [block-timestamp](https://github.com/subquery/tutorials-block-timestamp) | Indexes timestamp of each finalized block | Another simple __call handler__ function |
