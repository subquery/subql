## Getting started

Contributions to our repositories are made through Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in promptly but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly @ mention in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
