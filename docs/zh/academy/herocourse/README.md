Our first course is the SubQuery Hero Course and will be available from Friday 22 October 2021. The course will be released with a new module every week for six weeks based on the following structure:

Within each module there are several 5 to 10 minute lessons which are delivered by a recorded video. The video content is accompanied by written tutorials, slides, Lab workbooks, and links to the finished GitHub code repository. The course is designed to get a developer from knowing nothing about SubQuery to becoming an expert in building a SubQuery data source for their new blockchain application. This includes developing complex SubQuery Projects and deploying them in SubQuery Projects.

> _“SubQuery has been designed to help developers unlock value from blockchain data easily and quickly. That’s why onboarding new developers and teaching them the skills they need to build the dApps of tomorrow is incredibly important to the success of our community. The SubQuery Hero Course is going to be the first of many courses teaching valuable skills in our new SubQuery Academy”_ — James Bayly (Head of Business Development)

In the next few months, we will be adding bonus content to our SubQuery Hero Course so please watch out for updates. In addition, we will also be translating the existing course material to various languages to help drive towards our mission of making the world’s decentralised data more accessible!
