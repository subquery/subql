# 映射

映射函数定义了如何将链数据转换为我们先前在`schema.GraphQL`文件中定义的优化GraphQL的具体解决办法。

映射是用名为 AssemblyScript 的TypeScript 子集写的，它可以编译到WASM (WebAssembly)。
- 映射在`src/Mappings`目录中定义，并作为函数导出
- 这些映射也可以在`src/index.ts中导出</li>
<li>映射文件在映射处理程序下的<code>project.yaml`中引用。

有三类映射函数[Block handlers](#block-handler)，[Event Handlers](#event-handler)和[Call Handlers](#call-handler)。

## 区块处理器

You can use block handlers to capture information each time a new block is attached to the Substrate chain, e.g. block number. To achieve this, a defined BlockHandler will be called once for every block. 为了实现这一点，将为每个区块调用一次已定义的BlockHandler。

```ts
import {SubstrateBlock} from "@subql/types";

export async function handleBlock(block: SubstrateBlock): Promise<void> {
    // Create a new StarterEntity with the block hash as it's ID
    const record = new starterEntity(block.block.header.hash.toString());
    record.field1 = block.block.header.number.toNumber();
    await record.save();
}
```

[SubstrateBlock](https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql/blob/a5ab06526dcffe5912206973583669c7f5b9fdc9/packages/types/src/interfaces.ts#L16)是[signedBlock](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/cookbook/blocks/)的扩展接口类型，同样包括`specVersion`和`timestamp`。

## 事件处理器

当某些事件包含在一个新的区块上时，您可以使用事件处理程序来捕获信息。 You can use event handlers to capture information when certain events are included on a new block. The events that are part of the default Substrate runtime and a block may contain multiple events.

在处理过程中，事件处理程序将接收一个底层事件作为参数，该事件具有类型化的输入和输出。 任何类型的事件都会触发映射，允许使用数据源捕获活动。 During the processing, the event handler will receive a substrate event as an argument with the event's typed inputs and outputs. Any type of event will trigger the mapping, allowing activity with the data source to be captured. You should use [Mapping Filters](./manifest.md#mapping-filters) in your manifest to filter events to reduce the time it takes to index data and improve mapping performance.

```ts
import {SubstrateEvent} from "@subql/types";

export async function handleEvent(event: SubstrateEvent): Promise<void> {
    const {event: {data: [account, balance]}} = event;
    // Retrieve the record by its ID
    const record = new starterEntity(event.extrinsic.block.block.header.hash.toString());
    record.field2 = account.toString();
    record.field3 = (balance as Balance).toBigInt();
    await record.save();
```

A [SubstrateEvent](https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql/blob/a5ab06526dcffe5912206973583669c7f5b9fdc9/packages/types/src/interfaces.ts#L30) is an extended interface type of the [EventRecord](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/blob/f0ce53f5a5e1e5a77cc01bf7f9ddb7fcf8546d11/packages/types/src/interfaces/system/types.ts#L149). Besides the event data, it also includes an `id` (the block to which this event belongs) and the extrinsic inside of this block. Besides the event data, it also includes an `id` (the block to which this event belongs) and the extrinsic inside of this block.

## Call Handler

Call handlers are used when you want to capture information on certain substrate extrinsics.

```ts
export async function handleCall(extrinsic: SubstrateExtrinsic): Promise<void> {
    const record = new starterEntity(extrinsic.block.block.header.hash.toString());
    record.field4 = extrinsic.block.timestamp;
    await record.save();
}
```

The [SubstrateExtrinsic](https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql/blob/a5ab06526dcffe5912206973583669c7f5b9fdc9/packages/types/src/interfaces.ts#L21) extends [GenericExtrinsic](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/blob/a9c9fb5769dec7ada8612d6068cf69de04aa15ed/packages/types/src/extrinsic/Extrinsic.ts#L170). It is assigned an `id` (the block to which this extrinsic belongs) and provides an extrinsic property that extends the events among this block. Additionally, it records the success status of this extrinsic. It is assigned an `id` (the block to which this extrinsic belongs) and provides an extrinsic property that extends the events among this block. Additionally, it records the success status of this extrinsic.

## Query States
Our goal is to cover all data sources for users for mapping handlers (more than just the three interface event types above). Therefore, we have exposed some of the @polkadot/api interfaces to increase capabilities. Therefore, we have exposed some of the @polkadot/api interfaces to increase capabilities.

These are the interfaces we currently support:
- [api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;()](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.query) will query the <strong>current</strong> block.
- [api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.multi()](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.query.multi/#multi-queries-same-type) 将在当前块上进行多个 <strong>相同</strong> 类型的查询。
- [api.queryMulti()](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.query.multi/#multi-queries-distinct-types) 将在当前块进行<strong>不同</strong>类型的多个查询。

These are the interfaces we do **NOT** support currently:
- ~~api.tx.*~~
- ~~api.derive.*~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.at~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.entriesAt~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.entriesPaged~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.hash~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.keysAt~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.keysPaged~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.range~~
- ~~api.query.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;.sizeAt~~

See an example of using this API in our [validator-threshold](https://github.com/subquery/subql-examples/tree/main/validator-threshold) example use case.

## RPC calls

We also support some API RPC methods that are remote calls that allow the mapping function to interact with the actual node, query, and submission. A core premise of SubQuery is that it's deterministic, and therefore, to keep the results consistent we only allow historical RPC calls. A core premise of SubQuery is that it's deterministic, and therefore, to keep the results consistent we only allow historical RPC calls.

Documents in [JSON-RPC](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc/#rpc) provide some methods that take `BlockHash` as an input parameter (e.g. `at?: BlockHash`), which are now permitted. We have also modified these methods to take the current indexing block hash by default. We have also modified these methods to take the current indexing block hash by default.

```typescript
// Let's say we are currently indexing a block with this hash number
const blockhash = `0x844047c4cf1719ba6d54891e92c071a41e3dfe789d064871148e9d41ef086f6a`;

// Original method has an optional input is block hash
const b1 = await api.rpc.chain.getBlock(blockhash);

// It will use the current block has by default like so
const b2 = await api.rpc.chain.getBlock();
```
- For [Custom Substrate Chains](#custom-substrate-chains) RPC calls, see [usage](#usage).

## Modules and Libraries

To improve SubQuery's data processing capabilities, we have allowed some of the NodeJS's built-in modules for running mapping functions in the [sandbox](#the-sandbox), and have allowed users to call third-party libraries.

Please note this is an **experimental feature** and you may encounter bugs or issues that may negatively impact your mapping functions. Please report any bugs you find by creating an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/subquery/subql). Please report any bugs you find by creating an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/subquery/subql).

### Built-in modules

Currently, we allow the following NodeJS modules: `assert`, `buffer`, `crypto`, `util`, and `path`.

Rather than importing the whole module, we recommend only importing the required method(s) that you need. Some methods in these modules may have dependencies that are unsupported and will fail on import. Some methods in these modules may have dependencies that are unsupported and will fail on import.

```ts
import {hashMessage} from "ethers/lib/utils"; //Good way
import {utils} from "ethers" //Bad way

export async function handleCall(extrinsic: SubstrateExtrinsic): Promise<void> {
    const record = new starterEntity(extrinsic.block.block.header.hash.toString());
    record.field1 = hashMessage('Hello');
    await record.save();
}
```

### Third-party libraries

Due to the limitations of the virtual machine in our sandbox, currently, we only support third-party libraries written by **CommonJS**.

We also support a **hybrid** library like `@polkadot/*` that uses ESM as default. However, if any other libraries depend on any modules in **ESM** format, the virtual machine will **NOT** compile and return an error. However, if any other libraries depend on any modules in **ESM** format, the virtual machine will **NOT** compile and return an error.

## Custom Substrate Chains

SubQuery can be used on any Substrate-based chain, not just Polkadot or Kusama.

You can use a custom Substrate-based chain and we provide tools to import types, interfaces, and additional methods automatically using [@polkadot/typegen](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/typegen/).

In the following sections, we use our [kitty example](https://github.com/subquery/subql-examples/tree/main/kitty) to explain the integration process.

### Preparation

在项目 `src` 文件夹下创建一个新的目录 `api-interface` 来存储所有需要并生成的文件。 We also create an `api-interfaces/kitties` directory as we want to add decoration in the API from the `kitties` module.

#### Metadata

We need metadata to generate the actual API endpoints. In the kitty example, we use an endpoint from a local testnet, and it provides additional types. We need metadata to generate the actual API endpoints. In the kitty example, we use an endpoint from a local testnet, and it provides additional types. Follow the steps in [PolkadotJS metadata setup](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/typegen#metadata-setup) to retrieve a node's metadata from its **HTTP** endpoint.

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1", "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```
or from its **websocket** endpoint with help from [`websocat`](https://github.com/vi/websocat):

```shell
//Install the websocat
brew install websocat

//Get metadata
echo state_getMetadata | websocat 'ws://127.0.0.1:9944' --jsonrpc
```

Next, copy and paste the output to a JSON file. Next, copy and paste the output to a JSON file. In our [kitty example](https://github.com/subquery/subql-examples/tree/main/kitty), we have created `api-interface/kitty.json`.

#### Type definitions
We assume that the user knows the specific types and RPC support from the chain, and it is defined in the [Manifest](./manifest.md).

Following [types setup](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/typegen#metadata-setup), we create :
- `src/api-interfaces/definitions.ts` - this exports all the sub-folder definitions

```ts
export { default as kitties } from './kitties/definitions';
```

- `src/api-interfaces/kitties/definitions.ts` - type definitions for the kitties module
```ts
export default {
    // custom types
    types: {
        Address: "AccountId",
        LookupSource: "AccountId",
        KittyIndex: "u32",
        Kitty: "[u8; 16]"
    },
    // custom rpc : api.rpc.kitties.getKittyPrice
    rpc: {
        getKittyPrice:{
            description: 'Get Kitty price',
            params: [
                {
                    name: 'at',
                    type: 'BlockHash',
                    isHistoric: true,
                    isOptional: false
```

#### Packages

- In the `package.json` file, make sure to add `@polkadot/typegen` as a development dependency and `@polkadot/api` as a regular dependency (ideally the same version). We also need `ts-node` as a development dependency to help us run the scripts. We also need `ts-node` as a development dependency to help us run the scripts.
- We add scripts to run both types; `generate:defs` and metadata `generate:meta` generators (in that order, so metadata can use the types).

Here is a simplified version of `package.json`. Here is a simplified version of `package.json`. Make sure in the **scripts** section the package name is correct and the directories are valid.

```json
{
  "name": "kitty-birthinfo",
  "scripts": {
    "generate:defs": "ts-node --skip-project node_modules/.bin/polkadot-types-from-defs --package kitty-birthinfo/api-interfaces --input ./src/api-interfaces",
    "generate:meta": "ts-node --skip-project node_modules/.bin/polkadot-types-from-chain --package kitty-birthinfo/api-interfaces --endpoint ./src/api-interfaces/kitty.json --output ./src/api-interfaces --strict"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@polkadot/api": "^4.9.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.1.3",
    "@polkadot/typegen": "^4.9.2",
    "ts-node": "^8.6.2"
  }
```

### Type generation

Now that preparation is completed, we are ready to generate types and metadata. Run the commands below: Run the commands below:

```shell
# Yarn to install new dependencies
yarn

# Generate types
yarn generate:defs
```

In each modules folder (eg `/kitties`), there should now be a generated `types.ts` that defines all interfaces from this modules' definitions, also a file `index.ts` that exports them all.

```shell
# Generate metadata
yarn generate:meta
```

This command will generate the metadata and a new api-augment for the APIs. This command will generate the metadata and a new api-augment for the APIs. As we don't want to use the built-in API, we will need to replace them by adding an explicit override in our `tsconfig.json`. After the updates, the paths in the config will look like this (without the comments): After the updates, the paths in the config will look like this (without the comments):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
      // this is the package name we use (in the interface imports, --package for generators) */
      "kitty-birthinfo/*": ["src/*"],
      // here we replace the @polkadot/api augmentation with our own, generated from chain
      "@polkadot/api/augment": ["src/interfaces/augment-api.ts"],
      // replace the augmented types with our own, as generated from definitions
      "@polkadot/types/augment": ["src/interfaces/augment-types.ts"]
    }
}
```

### Usage

Now in the mapping function, we can show how the metadata and types actually decorate the API. The RPC endpoint will support the modules and methods we declared above. And to use custom rpc call, please see section [Custom chain rpc calls](#custom-chain-rpc-calls) The RPC endpoint will support the modules and methods we declared above. And to use custom rpc call, please see section [Custom chain rpc calls](#custom-chain-rpc-calls)
```typescript
export async function kittyApiHandler(): Promise<void> {
    //return the KittyIndex type
    const nextKittyId = await api.query.kitties.nextKittyId();
    // return the Kitty type, input parameters types are AccountId and KittyIndex
    const allKitties  = await api.query.kitties.kitties('xxxxxxxxx',123)
    logger.info(`Next kitty id ${nextKittyId}`)
    //Custom rpc, set undefined to blockhash
    const kittyPrice = await api.rpc.kitties.getKittyPrice(undefined,nextKittyId);
}
```

**If you wish to publish this project to our explorer, please include the generated files in `src/api-interfaces`.**

### Custom chain rpc calls

To support customised chain RPC calls, we must manually inject RPC definitions for `typesBundle`, allowing per-spec configuration. 您可以在 `project.yml` 中定义 `typesBundle`。 You can define the `typesBundle` in the `project.yml`. And please remember only `isHistoric` type of calls are supported.
```yaml
...
  ...
  types: {
    "KittyIndex": "u32",
    "Kitty": "[u8; 16]",
  }
  typesBundle: {
    spec: {
      chainname: {
        rpc: {
          kitties: {
            getKittyPrice:{
                description: string,
                params: [
                  {
                    name: 'at',
                    type: 'BlockHash',
                    isHistoric: true,
                    isOptional: false
                  },

```
