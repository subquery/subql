# Contributing to the SubQuery project
Welcome and a big thank you for considering contributing to the SubQuery open source projects! Together we can pave the way to a more decentralised future.

The following is a set of guidelines, not rules for contributing. Following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct
We take our open source community projects and responsibility seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/subquery/subql/blob/contributors-guide/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting started
Contributions to our repositories are made through Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in promptly but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. When logging an issue, explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots if possible.

### Submitting Pull Requests
In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

* Fork the repository to your own Github account
* Clone the project to your machine
* Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
* Commit changes to the branch
* Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
* Push changes to your fork
* Open a PR in our repository

## Coding Conventions

### Git Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

### JavaScript Styleguide
* All JavaScript code is linted with Prettier and ESLint
